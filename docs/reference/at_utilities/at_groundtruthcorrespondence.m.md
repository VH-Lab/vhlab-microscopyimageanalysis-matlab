# at_groundtruthcorrespondence

```
  AT_GROUNDTRUTHCORRESPONDENCE 
 
  STATS = AT_GROUNDTRUTHCORRESPONDENCE(ATD, COMPUTER_ROIS, MASKREGION_ROIS, GROUNDTRUTH_ROIS, ...)
 
  Given an array tomography directory object (ATDIR object) ATD and the names of ROIs that were
  generated by the computer (COMPUTER_ROIS), a mask region (such as a spine mask) MASKREGION_ROIS,
  and the ROIs that correspond to some ground truth measurement (GROUNDTRUTH_ROIS), this function
  calculates overlap.
 
  It is assumed that the ground truth ROIs only exist within the mask and not in other regions.
 
 
  Returns several statistics in STATS, a structure:

# at_colocalization_shiftxyz

```
  AT_COLOCALIZATION_SHIFTXYZ - Use BWCONNCOMP to compute ROIs from thresholded image
  
   OUT = AT_COLOCALIZATION_SHIFTXYZ(ATD, INPUT_ITEMNAME, OUTPUT_ITEMNAME, PARAMETERS)
 
   If the function is called with no arguments, then a description of the parameters
   is returned in OUT. OUT{1}{n} is the name of the nth parameter, and OUT{2}{n} is a
   human-readable description of the parameter. 
   OUT{3} is a list of methods for user-guided selection of these parameters.
